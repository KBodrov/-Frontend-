# -Frontend-

Hello! My name is Kirill Bodrov. 

I created this repository in order to brush up on my web application programming skills. I'm starting to remember the frontend, learning JavaScript, and slowly striving for the backend and full-stack development. 

Along the way, I find cool examples of modern menus or microinteractions on the net and collect them in Librarium (thanks to Warhammer 40k for my love of pretentious folder names =)) 


All this in order to create a system for accounting for the skills and projects of enthusiasts, as well as create a platform for interdisciplinary cooperation and support the open-source community.
I would be glad to interact and cooperate with other enthusiasts!
